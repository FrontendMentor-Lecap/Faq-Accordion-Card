## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Placing each of the images was a difficult task, it was a challenge to place the box outside the main element while setting main with an overflow of hidden.
I wanted to place each of the FAQ questions and answers without using JS, so that was also a challenge, specially playing with the :checked value, and modifying other elements. In this case I had to modify:

1. The arrow, so that it rotates 180 degrees.
2. The title, so it turns into a black color and bold.
3. Answer appears, as the display value changes from none to block.

As I exposed before, I really liked this challenge but I used a lot of time performing it. It still has a lot of room for improvement but I'm ready to present it to community.

### Continued development

I would like to continue focusing on transitions and animations. Also I would like to continue using CSS instead of JavaScript when it is possible.
